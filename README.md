# Data Visualization with Python


This is my first experience to create some charts and graphs by Python.
The sourse file is Olympics winter and I collected some data from the main file that I was  handed in my College class and made some charts to compare Medals achieved in Canada and USA. I also compared some medals achieved by Men and Women. It was fun! I enjoyed it. I attach my collected data below.
